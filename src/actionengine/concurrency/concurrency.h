/** @file
 *  @brief
 *    Concurrency utilities for ActionEngine.
 *
 *  This file provides a set of concurrency utilities for use in ActionEngine.
 *  That includes classes and functions for managing fibers, channels, and
 *  basic synchronization primitives: mutexes and condition variables.
 *
 *  This implementation is based on Boost::fiber, but it is designed to mimic
 *  closely the `thread::Fiber` and `thread::Channel` interfaces used
 *  internally at Google. A fully compatible implementation is neither a
 *  guarantee nor a goal, but the API is designed to be similar enough
 *  to be used interchangeably in most cases. The `Mutex` and `CondVar` classes
 *  provide the same basic functionality as their counterparts in Abseil.

/** @brief
 *    A lock that locks two mutexes at once.
 *
 *  This class is used to lock two mutexes at once, ensuring that they are
 *  locked in a deadlock-free manner. It is useful for situations where two
 *  mutexes need to be locked together, such as when accessing shared data
 *  structures that are protected by multiple mutexes, or in move constructors
 *  where two mutexes need to be held to ensure thread safety.
 *
 *  There is no sophisticated deadlock prevention logic in this class, but
 *  rather a simple ordering of mutexes based on their addresses.
