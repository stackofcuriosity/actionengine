 * is provided, the function will try to deduce the event loop from the

 *  returned as is.
 * @param loop
 *  The event loop to run the coroutine in. If not provided or globally set, the
 *  function will try to deduce it from previous library calls.
 * @param return_future
 *   If true, the function will return a Future object that can be used to
 *   wait for the coroutine to complete. If false, the function will return the
 *   coroutine result directly.
