/**
 * @brief
 *   An abstract interface for raw data storage and retrieval for ActionEngine
 *   nodes.
 *
 * This class provides a generic interface for storing and retrieving chunks of
 * data, identified by a sequence number. It supports both ordered and unordered
 * access to the chunks, as well as various operations such as putting, getting,
 * and popping chunks.
 *
 * @note
 *   A key feature of this interface is its flexibility, allowing it to be used
 *   in a wide range of scenarios, from simple in-memory storage to complex
 *   distributed systems.
 * @note
 *   However, this places a limitation: note that
 *   ChunkStore itself does not care about streaming semantics or, for example,
 *   range-based retrieval or writes. Streaming semantics are tackled by
 *   ChunkStoreReader and ChunkStoreWriter, which are built on top of this
 *   interface and are used together by AsyncNode to provide channel-like
 *   functionality.
 *
 * Importantly, the Get() and GetByArrivalOrder() methods are designed to
 * block until the requested chunk is available, allowing for synchronous
 * channel-like behavior. This is particularly useful in asynchronous workflows
 * by providing a way to wait for data to become available without having to
 * manage the underlying storage details or streaming semantics directly.
 *
 * ChunkStore can be implemented in various ways,
 * such as in-memory or file-based storage, in relational or key-value
 * databases, or even in distributed storage systems. The specific
 * implementation will determine how the chunks are stored and retrieved, but
 * the interface remains consistent across implementations.
 *
 * @note
 *   Efficiency and performance optimizations for specific
 *   storage backends, such as range-based queries, are expected to be
 *   implemented in concrete ChunkStore subclasses. This may change in the
 *   future as this interface evolves. For now, it is based, essentially,
 *   around keys and values.

  /** @brief
   *    Get a chunk by its sequence number from the represented store.
   *
   *  This method blocks until the chunk with the specified sequence number
   *  is available in the store, or until the specified timeout expires. As
   *  storage may be non-local, any errors encountered while retrieving the
   *  chunk will be returned as an absl::Status.
   *
   *  @param seq
   *    The sequence number of the chunk to retrieve.
   *  @param timeout
   *    The maximum duration to wait for the chunk to become available.
   *  @return
   *    A Chunk object containing the data associated with the specified
   *    sequence number, or an `absl::Status` indicating an error if the chunk
   *    could not be retrieved due to timeout or other issues.
   *
   *  @note
   *    This method may react to cancellation of the calling fiber, but it
   *    is not guaranteed to do so: that depends on the specific implementation.
   *    However, in cases when it becomes evident that the chunk can never be
   *    retrieved (e.g. writes were closed or final sequence number is less than
   *    the requested sequence number), correct implementations should return
   *    errors and not block indefinitely, even if the state only becomes
   *    evident after the method is called.

   *    Put a chunk into the store with the specified sequence number.

   *   The sequence number to associate with the chunk. Putting the same \p seq

   *   number will be added to the store.

   *   * ensuring that the sequence number is unique,
   *   * managing the finality of chunks and communicating that to

   *   * handling concurrent writes and reads without data corruption or loss.

   *   LocalChunkStore is a good example of such an implementation.
   *   redis::ChunkStore is another example, which implements this interface
   *   on top of Redis, leveraging its atomicity within Lua scripts to ensure
   *   that writes are safe and consistent.
